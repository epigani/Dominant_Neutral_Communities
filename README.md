## Overview

This repository contains the implementation and research materials for the project "Dominant and Neutral Communities Coexistence". The project investigates the dynamics, interactions, and coexistence patterns between dominant and neutral communities in complex systems.

## Abstract

Understanding how dominant and neutral communities interact and coexist is crucial for comprehending complex ecological, social, and biological systems. This project develops computational models and analytical frameworks to study the mechanisms that enable or prevent coexistence between communities with different dominance characteristics.

## Key Research Questions

- How do dominant communities influence the persistence of neutral communities?
- What are the critical conditions for stable coexistence?
- How do external perturbations affect community dynamics?
- What role do spatial structures play in community coexistence?

## Features

### Current Features
- [Coming Soon] Computational models for community dynamics
- [Coming Soon] Data analysis tools for community structure
- [Coming Soon] Visualization capabilities for coexistence patterns

### Planned Features
- [ ] Agent-based models for community interactions
- [ ] Network analysis tools for community detection
- [ ] Statistical analysis framework for coexistence metrics
- [ ] Interactive visualizations and dashboards
- [ ] Parameter sensitivity analysis tools
- [ ] Comparative analysis with empirical data

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/epigani/Dominant_Neutral_Communities.git
cd Dominant_Neutral_Communities

# Create a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies (when available)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Basic Example

```python
# Example code will be added as the project develops
import dominant_neutral_communities as dnc

# Initialize a community model
model = dnc.CommunityModel(
    dominant_size=100,
    neutral_size=50,
    interaction_strength=0.5
)

# Run simulation
results = model.simulate(time_steps=1000)

# Analyze results
analysis = dnc.analyze_coexistence(results)
print(analysis.summary())
```

### Running Experiments

```bash
# Example command-line usage (to be implemented)
python -m dominant_neutral_communities --experiment coexistence --params config.yaml
```

## Documentation

Detailed documentation will be available at [project documentation site] once development progresses.

### Key Concepts

- **Dominant Communities**: Communities with high influence on system dynamics
- **Neutral Communities**: Communities with limited direct influence but important for system stability
- **Coexistence Patterns**: Stable configurations where both community types persist
- **Interaction Networks**: The structural relationships between community members
